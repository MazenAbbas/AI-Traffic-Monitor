Video Object Detection with TensorFlow Hub

This project demonstrates a complete workflow for real-time video analysis and object detection. It utilizes a powerful, pre-trained deep learning model from TensorFlow Hub to identify and track objects in a video stream. This project showcases proficiency in processing sequential data (video frames) and applying state-of-the-art computer vision models for practical applications.

Key Features
Video Processing: Reads and processes video files frame by frame using OpenCV.

Pre-trained Model: Leverages a pre-trained SSD MobileNet V2 model for efficient and accurate object detection.

Confidence Scores: The model provides a confidence score for each detected object, indicating the certainty of its prediction.

Visual Output: Generates an output video with bounding boxes and labels around detected objects.

Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language.

OpenCV: Essential for video and image manipulation.

TensorFlow Hub: Used to access and load pre-trained deep learning models.

NumPy: For efficient numerical operations.
